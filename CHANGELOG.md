- Changed: Health timeline now includes activity, sleep and doctor-question

- Fixed: **Critical** — "Clear all data" caused an infinite-recursion crash
  in the single-file build, because the data-layer's internal
  `clearAllData` function and the Settings screen's button-handler function
  shared the same name. When bundled into one file, the second definition
  silently overwrote the first, so the delete button called itself forever
  instead of clearing data. Renamed the Settings handler to
  `handleClearAllDataClick` to remove the collision. Verified with an
  automated test that adds real data, clears it, and confirms it's gone.

## v1 — Initial single-file deployment
- Root cause of earlier GitHub Pages deployment failures identified:
  uploading `css/` and `js/` as subfolders was unreliable with the user's
  upload method, resulting in a page that loaded `index.html` but no
  styling or app logic.
- Fix: restructured the whole app as one self-contained `index.html`
  (inline CSS + inline JS), plus flat, root-level `manifest.json`,
  `service-worker.js` and icon files — no subfolders at all.

## v1 — Initial build
- First full build: dashboard, medicine manager, family/caregiver mode,
  blood pressure/sugar/weight/other vitals tracking with charts, health
  timeline, calendar, notes, health vault, monthly report with doctor/print
  view, insights, global search, English + Urdu (RTL), light/dark/medical
  themes, installable PWA with offline caching, export/import/clear data,
  accessibility basics, About page.
